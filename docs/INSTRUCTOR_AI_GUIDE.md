# Cobel AI Engine: Instructor Quick-Start Guide
## Role: Instructor / Lead Trainer

### 1. The Adaptive Progress Bar
- **Green**: Student is mastering technical terms/lexis efficiently.
- **Orange**: Friction detected (Density > 1.2). The AI is adapting the path.
- **Red**: Blocked. Requires Lead Trainer manual review.

### 2. Reviewing Assessments
- **Handwriting**: Use the 'Scan Preview' to see OCR confidence scores.
- **Audio**: Listen to the 'Oral Assessment' to verify pronunciation vs. transcript.

### 3. Overriding the AI
If the AI is too strict (e.g., it didn't recognize a valid synonym), the **Lead Trainer** can use the 'Admin Override' button to reset the density to 1.0.
